This branch contains the version compatible **only with Jira Cloud**.
If you need to build the application compatible with Jira Server or Data Center, please switch to the [server](https://bitbucket.org/almworks/jiraclient/branch/server) branch.
See the Branches section below for details.

## How to Build

### Prerequisites

In order to build the project you need [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) and [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/) version 8. 

1. Download Apache Ant from https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi 
  
     The build has been tested with Ant version 1.10.7

2. Download Oracle JDK 8 from [Java Download Archive](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)

     The build has been tested with version 8u192, though it is likely compatible with any JDK version
     from 8u112 to 8u202.
   
     Note, the build is NOT compatible with:
    
      * Java 9 and later
    
      * Java 8 updates before 8u112
    
      * any version of OpenJDK.   

### Build Steps

1. Have Apache Ant and Oracle JDK 8 installed on your system.

2. Check out the right branch of the repository.

     See the Branches section below in this file to choose the right one.
     
     Do NOT build the `master` branch.

3. Open the [build.sh](ant/build.sh) with a plain text editor.

4. Specify values of the ANT_HOME and JDK8_HOME variable.

5. Save the updated build.sh file.

6. Open command line terminal and go to the [ant](ant) directory (`cd ant`)

7. Run the [build.sh](ant/build.sh) shell script (`./build.sh`)

8. When the build successfully completes, find built application in the [build/.dist/jiraclient](/build/.dist/jiraclient)
directory.

     Find ZIPed application in the [build/.dist/jiraclient-NNNN.zip](/build/.dist/jiraclient-9876.zip) file.
   
For more details see the [build documentation](ant/BUILD.md)   

## How to Run

To start the built application run the start up script from command-line terminal.
The script is in the:

 * [jiraclient.sh](./build/.dist/jiraclient/bin/jiraclient.sh) for Mac
 
 * [linux_jiraclient.sh](./build/.dist/jiraclient/bin/linux_jiraclient.sh) for Linux
 
 * [jiraclient.bat](./build/.dist/jiraclient/bin/jiraclient.bat) for Windows
 
You can pass [workspace](https://wiki.almworks.com/display/jc16/Workspace) location as command-line parameter.

Client for Jira requires Oracle Java8 updates 8u112 to 8u202 (versions 8u192 or 8u202 are recommended).
Java either must be available on the PATH environment variable 
or JAVA_HOME variable must be defined and point to the corresponding JRE or JDK.

## Branches

Because of recent backward incompatible changes of Jira Cloud REST API, this
project has two branches:

 * [cloud](https://bitbucket.org/almworks/jiraclient/branch/cloud)
 This branch contains updates for Jira Cloud REST API.
 This application is not backward compatible with previous releases.

 * [server](https://bitbucket.org/almworks/jiraclient/branch/server)
 This branch contains sources of the latest Client for Jira release (version 3.8.4)
 with the latest fixes. This branch does not include updates for the recent 
 Jira Cloud REST API changes. It is not compatible with Jira Cloud, 
 but this branch is backward compatible with previous releases of Client for Jira.
